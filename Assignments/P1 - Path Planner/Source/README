1. Install clang and lld (Make sure clang-cl and lld-link are commands on your system) and wine

2. Run these commands (probably best to do this in your home directory):
dd if=/dev/zero of=msincludes.img bs=1024 count=$((1024 * 1024 * 4))
mkfs.exfat msincludes.img
mkdir ~/msincludes
sudo mount msincludes.img ~/msincludes

3. Get a copy of C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\ from a Windows machine with VS installed, put it in ~/msincludes/10sdk

4. Get a copy of C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Tools\MSVC\ and put it in ~/msincludes/msvc

After that your msincludes folder should look like this (folder names with numbers might vary slightly):
./msvc
./msvc/14.24.28314
./10sdk
./10sdk/App Certification Kit
./10sdk/bin
./10sdk/Catalogs
./10sdk/DesignTime
./10sdk/Extension SDKs
./10sdk/Include
./10sdk/Lib
./10sdk/Licenses
./10sdk/Platforms
./10sdk/Redist
./10sdk/References
./10sdk/Remote
./10sdk/SDKManifest.xml
./10sdk/Shortcuts
./10sdk/Source
./10sdk/Testing
./10sdk/UnionMetadata

5. `make`, `make run`, or `make clean`
(For reasons I don't fully understand rarely it will just break and need a clean)

Every time you reboot you will need to `sudo mount msincludes.img ~/msincludes` again
